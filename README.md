# CHB_Vets_Website
This website built for a Hawkes Bay-based veterinarian practice. They wanted an easy to navigate, reasonably basic webpage that displayed their location, operating hours and an after-hours contact number. Using these specifications I designed this website and they were very happy with it.

They have allowed me to post the source code to Github and for anyone to copy it.
